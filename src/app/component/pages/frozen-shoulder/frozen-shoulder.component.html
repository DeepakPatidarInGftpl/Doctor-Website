        Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis):
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> A condition characterized by the gradual onset of shoulder pain and stiffness, leading to
          decreased range of motion.</li>
        <li><b>Causes:</b> The exact cause is often unknown, but it may be associated with inflammation, injury, or
          underlying medical conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Stages:</b> Typically progresses through three stages - painful, frozen (stiffness predominates), and
          thawing (gradual improvement).</li>
      </ul>
