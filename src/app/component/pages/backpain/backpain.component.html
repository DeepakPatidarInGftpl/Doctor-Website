                    Back pain can have various causes, and treatment may depend on the specific issue. Here are some
                    common causes and general suggestions:

                </p>
                <div class="row g-3 pt-3">
                    <div class="col-sm-12 ">
                       
                            <ul>
                            <li> <b>Muscle Strain:</b> Overexertion or improper lifting can strain the muscles in your
                                back. Rest, gentle stretching, and over-the-counter pain medications may help.
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Herniated Disc:</b> This occurs when the soft tissue inside the discs between your
                                vertebrae pushes out. Treatment may involve physical therapy, medications, or in severe
                                cases, surgery.
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Sciatica:</b> Compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve can cause pain that
                                radiates down the leg. Treatment may include physical therapy, medications, or in some
                                cases, surgery.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Structural Issues:</b> Scoliosis, spinal stenosis, or other structural problems can
                                contribute to back pain. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause and may include
                                physical therapy, medications, or surgery.
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Lifestyle Factors: </b>Lack of exercise, obesity, and smoking can contribute to back
                                pain. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and maintaining a healthy
                                weight, can be beneficial.
                            </li></ul>
                            <p>If you're experiencing persistent or severe back pain, it's important to seek medical
                                attention. Your healthcare provider can perform a thorough examination, order diagnostic
                                tests if necessary, and recommend an appropriate treatment plan based on the underlying
                                cause of your back pain.
                            </p>
