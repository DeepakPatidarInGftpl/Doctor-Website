                DRY NEEDLING</h5>
            <p class="mt-4">Dry needling is a therapeutic technique used by healthcare professionals, typically physical therapists, chiropractors, and some physicians, to treat myofascial pain and muscle dysfunction. It involves the insertion of thin, solid needles into specific trigger points in muscles, tendons, ligaments, or near nerves to elicit a therapeutic response. Dry needling is distinct from traditional acupuncture, as it focuses on targeting trigger points and musculoskeletal issues rather than following the principles of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here are key points about dry needling:

            <ul>
                <li> <h6 class="d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase border-bottom border-5 mt-3"style="color: #13C5DD !important;">Trigger Points:
                </h6></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dry needling primarily targets trigger points, which are hyperirritable spots in skeletal muscle associated with palpable nodules or bands of muscle fibers. These points may contribute to pain and muscle dysfunction.</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><h6 class="d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase border-bottom border-5"style="color: #13C5DD !important;">Needle Type:</h6></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The needles used in dry needling are thin and solid, unlike the hollow needles used in acupuncture for traditional Chinese medicine. The needles are typically inserted directly into the muscle tissue.

            </ul>

        <ul>
            <li> <h6 class="d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase border-bottom border-5"style="color: #13C5DD !important;">Mechanical and Neurological Effects:
            </h6></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The insertion of the needles is believed to cause mechanical disruption of the tissue and stimulate a local twitch response in the muscle. This twitch response is thought to have a therapeutic effect on the trigger point and surrounding tissue.
                </li>
                <li>The process may also influence the nervous system, including pain modulation and the release of neurotransmitters.
