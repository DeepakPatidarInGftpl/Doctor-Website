             IASTM</h5>
            <p class="mt-4">IASTM stands for Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization. It is a therapeutic technique used by healthcare professionals, including physical therapists and chiropractors, to address soft tissue restrictions, scar tissue, and fascial adhesions. IASTM involves the use of specially designed instruments to perform controlled mechanical stimulation of the soft tissues, promoting healing and improved mobility.

            <br>
            <p>Here are some key points about IASTM:

                </h6></li>
            <ul>
                <li>IASTM tools are typically made of stainless steel or other materials with beveled edges and various shapes. These instruments are designed to detect and treat soft tissue abnormalities effectively.</li>

                </h6></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The primary goals of IASTM include breaking down scar tissue and fascial restrictions, reducing pain, improving range of motion, and enhancing functional movement patterns.

            </h6></li>
            <ul>
              <li>During an IASTM session, the practitioner applies the instruments to the patient's skin in a specific manner, creating controlled microtrauma to the targeted soft tissues.
            </li>
            <li>The tools are used to detect and treat areas of fibrosis, adhesions, or restrictions in the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia.

            <ul>
              <li>IASTM is believed to stimulate the body's natural healing processes, leading to increased blood flow, tissue regeneration, and improved tissue mobility.

            </li>
            <li>It may be incorporated into the overall treatment plan for individuals undergoing rehabilitation or those with chronic musculoskeletal conditions.</li>
