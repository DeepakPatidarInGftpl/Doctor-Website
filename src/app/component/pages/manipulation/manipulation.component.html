                Manipulation and mobilization 
            </h5>
            <p class="mt-4"> <b> Manipulation and mobilization  </b> are manual therapy techniques used by healthcare professionals, particularly in the fields of physical therapy, chiropractic care, and osteopathy. These techniques involve the skilled application of force to joints and soft tissues with the goal of improving mobility, reducing pain, and restoring normal function. While both manipulation and mobilization share common goals, they differ in terms of the amplitude and speed of the applied force.

                <li>Manipulation, often referred to as spinal or joint manipulation, involves a high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust applied to a joint. This means that the force applied is rapid and occurs within a short range of motion.â€¢	Manipulation, often referred to as spinal or joint manipulation, involves a high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust applied to a joint.
