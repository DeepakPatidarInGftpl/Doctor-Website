                <h3>Common Causes of Knee Pain:</h3>
                <li><b>Osteoarthritis:</b> Degeneration of the cartilage in the knee joint can lead to pain and
                    stiffness.</li>
                <li><b>Rheumatoid Arthritis:</b> An autoimmune condition that affects the joints, including the knees.
                </li>
                <li><b>Injuries:</b> Ligament, tendon, or meniscus injuries, such as sprains, strains, or tears.</li>
                <li><b>Overuse or Repetitive Strain:</b>Excessive use of the knee joint, especially in activities that
                    involve repetitive movements, can lead to pain.</li>
                <li><b>Bursitis:</b> Inflammation of the bursae, small sacs of fluid that cushion the knee joint.</li>
                <li><b>Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (Runner's Knee): </b>Pain around the kneecap often associated with
                    overuse or misalignment.</li>
                <li><b>Meniscus Tears:</b> Tears in the meniscus, the cartilage that cushions the knee joint.</li>

                <h3> General Suggestions for Managing Knee Pain:</h3>
                <li><b> Rest:</b> Give your knee time to heal by avoiding activities that exacerbate the pain.</li>
                <li><b> Ice and Compression:</b> Applying ice packs and using compression can help reduce inflammation.
                </li>
                <li><b> Elevation:</b> Elevating the affected leg when resting can also help minimize swelling.</li>
                <li><b>Pain Medications:</b> Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal
                    anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be helpful.</li>
                <li><b> Physical Therapy: </b> exercises can strengthen the muscles around the knee, improving stability
                    and reducing pain.</li>
                <li><b>Supportive Footwear:</b> Wearing comfortable and supportive shoes can make a difference,
                    especially if foot alignment contributes to knee pain.</li>
                <li><b> Weight Management:</b> Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce stress on the knee joints.</li>
                <li><b>Orthotics or Braces:</b> These devices can provide support and help alleviate pain in some cases.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your knee pain persists or worsens, it's crucial to seek professional medical advice. Depending on the
                underlying cause, your healthcare provider may recommend imaging tests (X-rays, MRI) and may suggest
                additional treatments, including medications and surgical intervention.</p>
